# Babylon.js Measurement Tool - Invisible Objects Issue
**Date:** 2025-10-22
**Status:** UNRESOLVED - Objects created but not rendering

---

## Problem Summary

The Babylon.js measurement tool creates spheres and lines successfully (confirmed by console logs), but **they are not visible in the scene**. This is extremely unusual - all object properties indicate they should be visible, but nothing renders.

---

## What We Know FOR CERTAIN (from console logs)

**Console output proves objects ARE being created:**

```
✅ Created sphere: diameter=10.0, position=(-8.73, 6.58, -0.00)
   Sphere visible: true, enabled: true, renderingGroupId: 0
   Total vertices: 703
   Scene has 477 meshes total

✅ Created line: length=8.66
   Line visible: true, enabled: true, renderingGroupId: 0
   Total vertices: 2
```

**Key facts:**
- ✅ Spheres ARE created (diameter: 10.0 units - HUGE)
- ✅ Lines ARE created
- ✅ Objects marked `isVisible: true`
- ✅ Objects marked `isEnabled: true`
- ✅ Objects have geometry (703 vertices for sphere)
- ✅ Scene mesh count increases (477 → 478 → 479)
- ✅ Materials applied correctly
- ✅ `renderingGroupId: 0` (default, should always render)
- ❌ **BUT: Nothing visible in the scene**

## Attempts Made (All Failed)

### 1. Rendering Group Issues
- **Tried:** Changed from renderingGroupId 1 → 0
- **Result:** No change

### 2. Size Issues
- **Tried:** Increased sphere diameter: 1.0 → 5.0 → 10.0 units
- **Result:** No change (10-unit sphere should be MASSIVE)

### 3. Material Settings
- **Tried:**
  - Full emissive color (self-illuminated)
  - Removed specular highlights
  - `backFaceCulling = false`
  - `visibility = 1.0`
- **Result:** No change

### 4. Line Rendering Approach
- **Tried:** Tubes → Simple Lines (most basic Babylon.js approach)
- **Result:** No change

### 5. Camera Controls Interference
- **Fixed:** Camera rotation interfering with measurement clicks
- **Solution:** Detach camera controls during measurement mode
- **Result:** Clicks work perfectly, but objects still invisible

### 6. Event System
- **Fixed:** Observable events firing correctly
- **Confirmed:** Picking works, points detected accurately
- **Result:** Object creation triggered, but still invisible

### 7. Test Spheres
- **Tried:** Created 5 static test spheres on scene load
- **Result:** Test spheres WERE visible (sizes 2, 4, 6, 8, 10)
- **Key Finding:** Sphere creation WORKS in general, but measurement spheres don't appear

---

## Current Code State

### File: `src/webui/src/viewers/babylon-viewer/hooks/useBabylonMeasurement.ts`

**Sphere Creation (lines 89-111):**
```typescript
const sphere = MeshBuilder.CreateSphere(`measurePoint_${Date.now()}`, {
  diameter: 10.0, // HUGE sphere
  segments: 32
}, scene);
sphere.position = point.clone();

const sphereMat = new StandardMaterial(`measurePointMat_${Date.now()}`, scene);
sphereMat.diffuseColor = new Color3(1, 0, 0); // Red
sphereMat.emissiveColor = new Color3(1, 0, 0); // Full glow
sphereMat.specularColor = new Color3(0, 0, 0);
sphereMat.backFaceCulling = false;
sphere.material = sphereMat;
sphere.isPickable = false;
sphere.renderingGroupId = 0;
sphere.visibility = 1.0;
```

**Line Creation (lines 124-132):**
```typescript
const line = Mesh.CreateLines(`distance_line_${Date.now()}`, newPoints, scene);
line.color = new Color3(1, 0, 0); // Red
line.isPickable = false;
line.renderingGroupId = 0;
```

**Observable Setup (lines 229-284):**
- Uses `scene.onPointerObservable`
- Handles `POINTERDOWN` and `POINTERUP` events
- Performs manual picking with `scene.pick()`
- Properly detects clicks vs drags

---

## What Works Perfectly

1. ✅ **Measurement Mode Activation:** Button toggles mode correctly
2. ✅ **Cursor Management:** Crosshair appears in measurement mode
3. ✅ **Camera Control Disabling:** Model doesn't rotate during measurement
4. ✅ **Observable Events:** POINTERDOWN/POINTERUP firing correctly
5. ✅ **Picking:** Accurately detects mesh hits and 3D points
6. ✅ **Distance Calculation:** Correct distance computed
7. ✅ **Object Creation:** Spheres and lines created with valid geometry
8. ✅ **Test Spheres:** Static spheres created on load ARE visible

---

## The Mystery: Why Test Spheres Work But Measurement Spheres Don't

**Test Spheres (VISIBLE - from BabylonViewer.tsx:75-150):**
- Created in `useEffect` when scene is ready
- Same API: `MeshBuilder.CreateSphere()`
- Same material setup: `StandardMaterial` with emissive
- Positioned at Y=10, spread across X axis

**Measurement Spheres (INVISIBLE - from useBabylonMeasurement.ts:89-111):**
- Created in `addMeasurementPoint` callback
- Same API: `MeshBuilder.CreateSphere()`
- Same material setup: `StandardMaterial` with emissive
- Positioned at picked points from model

**Key Difference:** Timing/lifecycle? State management? React rendering cycle?

## Theories to Investigate Tomorrow

### Theory 1: React State Timing Issue
**Hypothesis:** Objects created during Observable callback might not be properly registered in the scene's render loop.

**Test:**
```typescript
// Force scene to re-register the mesh
scene.addMesh(sphere);
scene.render();
```

### Theory 2: Frozen/Culled Meshes
**Hypothesis:** Scene might be freezing or culling dynamically created meshes.

**Test:**
```typescript
sphere.freezeWorldMatrix(); // Try both with and without
scene.unfreezeActiveMeshes();
```

### Theory 3: Scene Rendering Pipeline Issue
**Hypothesis:** Measurement objects created after initial scene setup aren't in rendering pipeline.

**Test:**
```typescript
// Check if mesh is in active meshes
console.log('Active meshes:', scene.getActiveMeshes());
console.log('Is sphere in active:', scene.getActiveMeshes().includes(sphere));
```

### Theory 4: Camera Frustum Culling
**Hypothesis:** Objects positioned outside camera's view frustum.

**Test:**
```typescript
// Check if sphere is in frustum
console.log('In frustum:', sphere.isInFrustum(camera));
// Disable frustum culling
sphere.alwaysSelectAsActiveMesh = true;
```

### Theory 5: Layer Mask Issue
**Hypothesis:** Camera's layer mask doesn't include measurement objects.

**Test:**
```typescript
sphere.layerMask = camera.layerMask;
console.log('Camera layer mask:', camera.layerMask);
console.log('Sphere layer mask:', sphere.layerMask);
```

### Theory 6: Z-Fighting or Depth Buffer Issue
**Hypothesis:** Objects rendered but hidden by depth buffer issues.

**Test:**
```typescript
// Try disabling depth testing
sphereMat.disableDepthWrite = false;
sphereMat.depthFunction = Engine.ALWAYS;
```

### Theory 7: Observable Callback Context
**Hypothesis:** Creating meshes inside Observable callback causes issues.

**Test:**
- Move mesh creation outside Observable callback
- Use a message queue or ref to defer creation
- Create mesh, then modify position in next frame

---

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Add exhaustive debugging:**
   - Log `scene.getActiveMeshes()` before/after creation
   - Log camera frustum check
   - Log layer masks
   - Log render info: `scene.getRenderId()`, `mesh.isReady()`

2. **Try deferred creation:**
   ```typescript
   // Store points, create meshes in next frame
   setTimeout(() => {
     const sphere = MeshBuilder.CreateSphere(...);
     // ...
   }, 0);
   ```

3. **Test in Babylon Playground:**
   - Create minimal reproduction in official playground
   - If it works there, compare with our setup
   - If it fails there, it's a fundamental Babylon.js issue

4. **Compare with working examples:**
   - Check how test spheres differ from measurement spheres
   - Look at Babylon.js forum examples
   - Check WebXR measurement repo (if accessible)

5. **Nuclear option - Scene Inspector:**
   - Enable Babylon.js Inspector in dev mode
   - Manually inspect scene hierarchy
   - Check if objects appear in inspector but not visually

## Related Issues Fixed Today

1. ✅ **Spatial tree visibility** - Added embedded mode to SpatialTreePanel
2. ✅ **Property loading** - Changed to API-first approach (ThreeJS pattern)
3. ✅ **Selection during measurement** - Disabled selection handler in measurement mode
4. ✅ **Axes toggle** - Fixed with useCallback
5. ✅ **Camera rotation during measurement** - Detach camera controls
6. ✅ **Event system** - Switched to Babylon Observable pattern
7. ✅ **Measurement picking** - Manual `scene.pick()` works perfectly

## Important Notes

- **The objects ARE being created** - this is not a creation problem
- **Console logs prove all properties correct** - not a configuration problem
- **Test spheres work** - not a general sphere rendering problem
- **This is a rendering/visibility problem** - something about the render pipeline

The fact that test spheres work but measurement spheres don't suggests this is either:
- A timing issue (when objects are added to scene)
- A scene state issue (something about Observable callback context)
- A React lifecycle issue (state updates interfering with Babylon.js)

## Conclusion

This is a very unusual issue. The fact that objects have all correct properties but don't render suggests something fundamental about how Babylon.js manages its render loop or how dynamically created objects are registered. The breakthrough will likely come from understanding why test spheres work but measurement spheres don't, despite using identical APIs.

**Key Question:** What is different about objects created in Observable callbacks vs objects created in React useEffect?
